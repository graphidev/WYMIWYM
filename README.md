What You Mark Is What You Mean
==============================

But please call me **WYMIWYM**.

**Dislaimer**:
This project is a prototype still in development.

Dependencies
------------

WYMIWYM is based on [CodeMirror](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/) provided by [Marijn Haverbeke](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/) (a big thanks to him) !


Features
--------

This editor is a markdown specific extension of CodeMirror. It provides :

- keyboards shortcuts (Mac compatible, replace `CTRL` by `CMD`):
    - `CTRL+I` : Toggle italic markup
    - `CTRL+B` : Toggle bold markup
    - `CTRL+D` : Toggle strikethrough markup
    - `CTRL+K` : Set link markup
    - `CTRL+L` : Toggle unordered list markup
    - `CTRL+E` : Toggle quote markup
    - `CTRL+SHIFT+L` : Toggle ordered list markup
    - `CTRL+SHIFT+D` : Duplicate selected lines
    - `TAB` : Indent selected lines
    - `SHIFT+TAB` : Unindent selected lines
    - `ENTER` : Indent lists continuity
    - `SHIFT+ENTER` : Indent lists continuity

- default behavior overrinding
- Optimised syntax coloration
- Extensibility as of methods may be called outsite of the object


Usage
-----

This is as simple as this :

``` javascript
var editor = new Wymiwym(
    document.querySelector('textarea[name="content"]')
);
```

Then you can implement interactions with these methods :

- `toggleBold()`
- `toggleItalic()`
- `toggleDelete()`
- `toggleOrderedList()`
- `toggleUnorderedList()`
- `indentLines()`
- `unindentLines()`

Check the source code for more.


A word on markup methods
------------------------

### Inline

Inline toggling markup methods (such as `toggleBold`, `toggleItalic`, `toggleDelete`) match the markup arround and inside before adding or removing markup.

Here is a sample :
Note: brackets match cursor selection. eg: `here is [selection]`

``` markdown
This text contains **[bold]**, [_italic_] and something that should be [deleted].
```

When toggling markup, this will be rederend :

``` markdown
This text contains [bold], [italic] and something that should be ~~[deleted]~~.
```

### Block

Block toggling methods markup try to match first lines charaters markup. If it doesn't, markup is added at the beggining of the line.


Know issues
-----------

As of CodeMirror does not provide an API for multiple cursors position (other than `start`, `end` and `main`), some trouble may appear by using the multiple selection.

Prefer selecting multiple lines within one only selection.
